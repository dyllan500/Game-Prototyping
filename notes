player spawns in unaware of who they are 
they start bulding a camp to live
npc comes to help when player builds to a certain level
more npcs will come when various things are built
player can gain taxes from npcs
once player grows big enough they are greeted by a general to the king
king orders them to bend the knee and pay the taxes to the king or face consqunces
player can chose to fight or bend knee
player can change mind about the decision only once

knee bending players can contiue to expand their village but must pay taxes to kill but have better trade routes for goods and access to npcs from the kingdom

non knee benders get rebel npcs who abose the king, dont pay taxes have to fight kings men every so often but if built up enough can kill the king and take over his land/kingdom
